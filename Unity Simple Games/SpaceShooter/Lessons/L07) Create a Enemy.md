# L7) Create the Enemy Object

This tutorial demonstrates how to create Game Objects in Unity

## Use a Square Game Object for the Enemy

In the **Hierarchy**, add a Square Game Object and name it "Enemy"

- 2D Object > Sprites > Square

## In the Inspector notice 2 COMPONENTS have been created

**Transform**

- Controls WHERE the Square Game Object is

**Sprite Renderer**

## Adjust the Enemy's Position in the Scene View

There are 2 ways to change the Position:
**1) Transform Component's Position**

- X = 0
